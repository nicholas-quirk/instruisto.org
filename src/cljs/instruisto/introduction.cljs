    :body "Esperanto is the most popular constructed international auxiliary language. It was created in 1887 by L. L. Zamenhof, a Polish doctor and linguist. The language is heavily influenced by Romance, Germanic and Slavic languages. If you already speak a European language then learning Esperanto is relatively easy. The language consists of regular verbs and a prefix/suffix system for word building. By knowing only a couple hundred root words and all the prefixes and suffixes, your vocabulary can increase by ten fold."

    :body "Esperanto was created in a region of Poland where there were many languages spoken. Zamenhof understood that distrust and hatred between groups of people started with miscommunication. If people could all speak a common language, that was independent of any group or region, then all parties would be on equal grounds. Neither person communicating would be inferior to the other."

    :body "Exact number of Esperanto speakers is unknown since the language has no homeland. Numbers show anywhere between 10,000 â€“ 2,000,000 L2 speakers. Regardless of the number of speakers, Esperanto is an active language with the World Congress of Esperanto held annually. There is a thriving community of Esperanto speakers producing music, books, pod-casts and websites around the language. Even if you don't become a fluent Esperanto speaker, learning the language will prime you when learning another foreign language."
